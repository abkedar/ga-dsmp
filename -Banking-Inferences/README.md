### Project Overview

 The Project dataset was Banking related. The main motive of project was to work with real datasets and to get how we can apply inference statistics and descriptive statictics concept to solve the give task. And now to interpret the given task in coding format.


### Learnings from the project

 Interpreting the question ask in wording format into the graphical or mathematical way was really a good exprience to learn. Even how it need to present to other person so another person can take suitable action, in response to our outcome i.e easy approach.


### Challenges faced

 The main challenges which I face while doing project was the one to fully understand what the question or what the task is actually. And to also interpret it coding format by using open source code. One to need to keep update not only therotical but also coding concept.
