### Project Overview

 This Project data is about Melbourne housing Price prediction. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features, like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent,price of the house, etc. And the prediction is achieve using Regularization regression.


### Learnings from the project

 **This project cover the following concept and algorithm and how we can apply it on the multiple feature and numerical dataset:**

- Train-test split

- Correlation between the features

- Linear Regression

- Polynomial Regressor

- Lasso Regressor

- Ridge Regressor

- R ^2 Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 This project show how we can apply regression method on datasets of Housing Price. This dataset is numerical in form and has multiple features, so there are some features which has Correlation between them, this need to resolve. If overfitting or underfitting occured how we can solve it. After the prediction of price done, are the predicted value are close to or same as expected value. This each concept is cover in separate task. To get a clear understanding of applying and also observing output.
