### Project Overview

 This project dataset is taken from lending.com. This data consist inforation of all those people whoe need money from the investor. The information is individual who have taken loan in pas or not. If yes that type of loan, how mauch was his loan, its interest rate, did he return the loan full, in how many days did he return it and many more. Looking at this data and working with probability concept will the borrower return the full loan in given time. This what investor want to find out.


### Learnings from the project

 Th concept cover in this project probability related method and vusualizing technique. 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The project features are mostly in numerical and categorical in form, but for this project only numerical data is use so the probability concept can be applied. Before proceding further the data need to be sortout and presented in such proper that probability can be applied. So a proper information of data and even mathematical must be known if one work on such data. Visualizing was the most important part. For this I need ask proper question that what i was to see through this project.
