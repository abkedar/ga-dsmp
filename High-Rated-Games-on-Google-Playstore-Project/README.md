### Project Overview

 The dataset use for project is download from google play store which has information of application name, their rating, type of application, number of Reviews, price, and Last update as data feature. This project consist of all the method and technique we can apply in EDA before applying machine learning algorithm to make our decision more simpler and firm.


### Learnings from the project

 **This concept and method cover in this project are as follows:**

- Plot Histogram

- Cleaning the data and working on datetime datatype.

- Visualization using Seaborn(Boxplot, Regplot)


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 As this project is to do EDA, it was indeed necessary to make the feature in proper format i.e fill null value, convert the feature in proper format and proper use of datetime feature. According to our porject task it was also necessary select only those feature which are either correlated or not with each other as EDA require that.


### Challenges faced

 The challenges face during this project were:

- Some feature were having too null values, it was need to be solve.

- The datatype of some feature were in not use format changing them solve it.

- Make or to visualize the features, the proper selection of seaborn technique and select only those which can give more input about our data  was also essential.
